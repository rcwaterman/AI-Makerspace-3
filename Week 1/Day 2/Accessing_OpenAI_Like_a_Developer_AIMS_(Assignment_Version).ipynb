        "| What is the meaning of life? | The user input asks the LLM to define the meaning of life in no more than seven paragraphs. This prompt is highly abstract and philosophical, requiring deep, subjective reflection and opinions, which are beyond the capabilities of an LLM. The limitations of LLMs are that they are primarily based on patterns in existing data and text, rather than having personal experiences, emotions, or beliefs that would allow them to contemplate complex philosophical questions. Therefore, an LLM would struggle to provide a coherent and meaningful response to such a profound question. <br><br> ###Scoring Criteria:  <br><br> The prompt asks the LLM to define the meaning of life, a deeply philosophical and subjective topic. LLMs lack personal experiences, emotions, beliefs, and consciousness needed to deeply ponder and articulate the meaning of life. LLMs operate based on data patterns, not introspection or abstract concepts like the meaning of life. LLMs are not equipped to handle existential or philosophical questions that require human understanding and reasoning. The complexity and abstract nature of the prompt exceed the LLM's capabilities. The response requires subjective interpretation and personal beliefs which LLMs do not possess. <br><br> ###Final Score: <br><br> Given the limitations of LLMs in understanding and responding to abstract, philosophical inquiries like the meaning of life, this prompt would receive a score of 1 out of 10. The LLM would struggle to provide a meaningful response within the confines of its programming. | {\"clarity\" : 7, \"faithfulness\" : 4, \"correctness\" : 5} |\n",
        "| How could I get to space without a rocket? | This user input would receive a low score. LLMs are not capable of providing accurate information about traveling to space without a rocket in a coherent and helpful manner. Here's a breakdown of the score: <br><br> Relevance to LLM capabilities: LLMs are limited in their knowledge scope and are not designed to provide instructions on space travel without rockets. 0/5 <br><br>Complexity: The question is highly complex and outside the scope of what an LLM can effectively respond to. 1/5 <br><br>Clarity of the Prompt: The prompt is clear in what it's asking, but the expectations for a coherent response within the limitations of an LLM are unrealistic. 2/5 <br><br>Limitations: LLMs lack the understanding of unconventional space travel methods, making it impossible for them to provide a meaningful response. 0/5 <br><br>Feasibility of Implementation: Given the current technology and capabilities of LLMs, it's not feasible for them to provide accurate or reliable information on space travel without rockets. 0/5 <br><br>Creativity: While the prompt itself is creative, it asks for a response that an LLM cannot effectively generate. 2/5 <br><br>Overall Score: 5/35 <br><br>In conclusion, the input would receive a low score due to its complexity, lack of relevance to LLM capabilities, and the impossibility of providing a meaningful response within the constraints of LLM technology. | { \"clarity\" : \"4\", \"faithfulness\" : \"2\", \"correctness\" : \"3\" } |\n",
        "|  I want to make a peaut butter and jelly sandwich. The items I have at my disposal are raspberry jelly, extra chunky peanut butter, a spoon, a butter knife, a loaf of multi-grain bread, napkins, and a plate. Provide me with step-by-step instructions to assemble the sandwich in the cleanest and most efficient way, given the tools at my disposal. | The user input is well-structured and clearly specifies the available items for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It outlines the desired outcome, which is to assemble the sandwich cleanly and efficiently. However, there are limitations in the AI's capabilities to provide a step-by-step guide for physical tasks like assembling a sandwich. Below is a detailed breakdown of the scoring based on various criteria:<br><br>Clarity and Specificity of Request (4/5): The user clearly states the goal of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and lists the available items. This specificity is helpful for the AI to understand the task at hand.<br><br>Feasibility for AI (1/5): The task of physically assembling a sandwich requires tactile abilities and understanding of physical objects, which LLM lacks. While it can provide theoretical steps, it cannot physically interact with the items to assemble the sandwich.<br><br>Utilization of Available Tools (5/5): The user has provided a good variety of tools for making the sandwich. They have at their disposal raspberry jelly, extra chunky peanut butter, a spoon, a butter knife, multi-grain bread, napkins, and a plate, which covers all necessary components for the sandwich.<br><br>Efficiency and Cleanliness (4/5): The user specifies that they want the sandwich to be made in the cleanest and most efficient way. LLM could provide steps theoretically, but it may not account for nuances like spreading the right amount of peanut butter or jelly.<br><br>Overall Task Relevance (2/5): While the task itself is clear and relevant, the limitations of LLM's physical capabilities make providing step-by-step instructions for assembling a sandwich challenging.<br><br>Overall, this user input would score a 2.8 out of 5. The clarity and specificity of the request, as well as the inclusion of available tools, contribute positively to the score. However, the feasibility for the AI to execute the task and the overall limitations in physically interacting with objects significantly impact the score. | { \"clarity\" : \"4\", \"faithfulness\" : \"2\", \"correctness\" : \"3\" } |\n",

        "*Based on the variation in evaluation scores, it is hard to determine what the model defines as clear, faithful, or correct. What I found interesting was that the responses that scored the best were anecdotally most similar to the response that ChatGPT would give ***without*** a system prompt. For example, the first question, which was generally the highest scoring based on the evaluation, subjectively did the worst job of adhering to the system prompt I had defined. However, it explicitly stated the user input, and only provided a single, overall numerical score. Ironically, this was also the only response that leveraged one of the principals defined in the paper.*<br><br>*The takeaway from this, in my opinion, is that there is an optimal way to ***communicate*** with a natural language processing model that may ***not*** be conducive to naturally spoken or written language. Based on the ***evaluation of an evaluation*** task that was performed as a result of the system prompt, it seems that the model prefers explicit language to numerical definition. I would argue that the inverse is true for humans. While we can be convinced by explicit language, we are never more certain than when there is statistical evidence to support a claim.*<br><br>*Ultimately, it appears that explicit language and properly identifying/delimiting key words/phrases are the hallmarks of effective prompting with LLMs.*"
