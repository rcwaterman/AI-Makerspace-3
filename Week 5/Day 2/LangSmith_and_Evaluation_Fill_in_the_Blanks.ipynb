Specific benchmarks can help measure function calling performance and overall agentic behavior. For instance, the provided context mentions test environments for tasks like the Relational Data task, which has been used to gauge model performance. It's also important to validate the LLM on the behavior patterns needed for the specific application before deploying it.\\n\\nFor example, the context describes evaluating agents on tasks that are prerequisites for common workflows and notes that even the best models can fail over longer trajectories or complex tasks. Additionally, performance metrics and error bars, like those mentioned for models such as GPT-4 and Claude-2.1, can provide insights into reliability and areas for improvement.\\n\\nOverall, assessing planning, tool use, and the ability to generalize across tasks can be key indicators of an agent's effectiveness.\""
