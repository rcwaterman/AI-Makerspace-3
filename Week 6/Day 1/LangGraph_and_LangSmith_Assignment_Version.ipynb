        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

            "\n",
            "Agent Response: RAG, which stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique used in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their performance by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. The key idea behind RAG is to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a large corpus of documents or a knowledge base.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How RAG Works:\n",
            "1. **Retrieval Step**: Given a query or input, the model first retrieves a set of relevant documents or passages from a large corpus. This is typically done using a retrieval model like BM25 or a dense retrieval model such as DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\n",
            "2. **Generation Step**: The retrieved documents are then used as additional context for a generative model (like GPT-3 or BERT) to produce a more informed and accurate response.\n",

            "### Benefits of RAG:\n",
            "- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging external knowledge, RAG can provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers.\n",
            "- **Reduced Hallucination**: Generative models are prone to \"hallucinating\" facts. RAG mitigates this by grounding the generation in real, retrieved documents.\n",
            "- **Scalability**: It allows the model to access a vast amount of information without needing to store all the knowledge within the model parameters.\n",
            "\n",
            "### When Did RAG Break Onto the Scene?\n",
            "RAG was introduced by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in a paper titled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,\" which was published in 2020. The paper demonstrated that RAG could significantly improve performance on various knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering and fact verification, by combining retrieval and generation in a single, end-to-end framework.\n",

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This can involve concatenating the retrieved information with the original query or using it to provide additional context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-3, BERT), is used to generate a response based on the augmented input. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses because it has access to the additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG models are particularly useful in scenarios where the information needed to answer a query is not contained within the model's parameters but can be found in external documents. This approach leverages the strengths of both retrieval and generation, leading to more accurate and informative responses.\""
